# Add Environment to Admin Bar
Add an indication to the Admin Bar of the environment WordPress is running in (e.g., Prod, Staging, Dev, etc)

## Description
**Note**: this plugin is current in a "pre-alpha-release" state, and so it's behavior is constantly changing.

This plugin as been renamed to [Show Environment in Admin Bar](https://github.com/pbiron/shc-show-env) (I told you it was "pre-alpha" ;-)  All further development will happen in that repo.  Eventually, this repo will be deleted.
